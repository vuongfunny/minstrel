Requirement
-------------------

NASM - Netwide Assembler, for compiling the asm source.


-------------------
Compile
-------------------
$ ./configure
$ make

There is an option named --enable-backward for backward compatibility.

-------------------
Install
-------------------
$ make install 
(need to be root)


then the lib will be installed to the default usr lib of your system (/usr/lib) 
named libmac.so*, the console frontend (now it is statically linked) to /usr/bin named 
mac, and some header files to /usr/include/mac.

There is also a sample analyzing program, located in src/Examples/Analyzer/Sample1,
which displays some information of the specified file. It is not installed.

Enjoy It!
