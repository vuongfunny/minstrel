Due to the license <License.htm>, so I can't make it public,
Last November, I decided to register mac-port at SourceForge,
so I had to choose an open source license, so I chosen LGPL
for this mac-port. It is close to the original license,
but doesn't get the permission from the original author, Matt.

This license would be changed when the author asks in the
future.
